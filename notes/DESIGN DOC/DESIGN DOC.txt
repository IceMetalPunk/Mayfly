GITHUB BUG GAME JAM

Auto-runner, being chased by "boss" Hive Mind
Hit action points, time slows and a mini/puzzle game pop-up bubble appears
--> Minigame actions affect runner (jump, dodge, attack, break walls, etc.)
--> Can also collect stat boosts (wings = higher jump, chitin = stronger defense, fangs = stronger offense, claws = stronger breaking, legs = boost speed, etc.)
--> After you go, Hive Mind takes its turn (see MINIGAME section below)
Goal: Get to end without dying from enemy damage or getting caught by Hive Mind
The more stat boosts you collect, the more XP in each stat you get at the end of each level
--> So collecting more wings gets you more XP towards permanent jump increase, etc.

KEYWORDS

Action Point: Opens a minigame to decide your action as well as the Hive Mind's action
Action Trigger: Executes your currently stored action, or the Hive Mind's next queued action
Circuit: Power-ups
Bounce Back: Getting bounced back to just before the previous Action Point, during which time the Hive Mind closes in on you a bit
--> Hitting a wall, or attacking an enemy but failing to kill it, causes you to Bounce Back
--> When Hive Mind hits a wall, it just gets stuck there and waits for your next Action Point to try and get a jump in.
Wall Breaking: Some walls are breakable, but they take time to break (depending on stats/powerups), so you'll pause in front of them while you smash them

MINIGAME

Top row = collectible blocks
Bottom row = single middle ENABLED / ON source
Middle rows = rows of ENABLED / OFF or HIDDEN nodes
At start of level:
  1. Bottom-up random connections to adjacent/corresponding nodes above (bottom source can potentially connect to ANY non-hidden node above it)
	a. After forming connections from row[x] to row[x+1], evaluate ON status for each newly connected row[x+1] node
	b. Propagation is just: `this.on = lowerConnected.some(node => node.enabled && node.on); upperConnected.forEach(propagate)`
	c. Technically don't need recursion for first pass when upper connections don't yet exist
  2. Top-down DISABLING of pathways
	a. As long as  a pathway turns top row ON, trace path back through connected ON nodes (DFS/BFS), then pick a random one, DISABLE it, and propagate ON state up

Action Point game:
  1. Player chooses a DISABLED node to ENABLE, then collects the blocks/actions/etc. at the top that this ends up powering.
	a. Timer pauses, and all time stops, after player makes a selection.
	b. If player doesn't select in time, they simply get nothing and can do nothing this Action.
  2. Hive Mind moves remaining blocks/actions to try and power the ones it wants
	a. If player didn't select in time, Hive Mind will ENABLE a node to do this instead
  3. All nodes ENABLE, then random DISABLING happens again
  4. New blocks/actions drop in to replace the missing ones

Whatever action is selected is stored, and then applied when the player hits the next Action Trigger
--> Hive Mind's actions go into a queue and are dequeued upon hitting an Action Trigger

ACTIONS

Each action has an associated power-up "circuit". When collected, that circuit provides a temporary boost related to both of its XP paths, and gives XP towards you picking one of them for permanent buffs.

Jump: For you = jump over things; For Hive = jump over things
-> Powerup = wings, XP paths = jump height or low grav

Dodge: For you = dodge at next Action Trigger (enemies are Action Triggers); For Hive = ?? No-op ??
-> Powerup = legs, XP paths = speed or action time limit increase
--> Powerup gives short-term speed boost, and next Action Point has longer time limit


Attack: For you = trigger battle at next Action Trigger if it's an enemy, or wall smash if next trigger is a breakable wall; For Hive = shoot at you
-> Battle means you deal damage to each other.
--> If they die, they are removed and you continue.
--> If you die, you die and restart the level.
--> If neither dies, you Bounce Back (giving you a chance to try Dodging instead)
-> Killing enemies earns you Hive XP, which can be spent on a Scramble cooldown decrease
--> Scramble is a power-up that you only have once you unlock Level 1 with Hive XP
--> Triggering it makes Hive's next minigame decision dumber, and then it goes on cooldown for a time dependent on the stats you have for it
-> Powerup = fangs, XP paths = damage power or wall breaking speed
--> Powerup gives you instant smash (or maybe 2x speed smash) on next wall break

Shield: For you and Hive = defend against bomb/projectile damage at next Action Trigger
-> Respawning mines will be on some Triggers; others will cause enemies in front of you to shoot. These don't bounce you back or slow you, but they deal damage
-> Powerup = chitin armor, XP paths = defense or fast bounce
--> Defense makes you take less damage from attacks; fast bounce makes you Bounce Back faster (giving Hive less time to catch up)
