# Mayfly: Hive Escape
## By IceMetalPunk, for Github Game-Off 2021

### Intro

The first version of the Mayfly was an exosuit for human pilots, designed to help us navigate difficult terrain.

Then we added AI...

...and now we're running for our lives to escape the Hive Mind.

### Game Info (In Progress - Plans)

In this autorunner/puzzle-RPG hybrid, you take control of a Mayfly Mark I exosuit and try to escape the grasp of the AI known as Hive Mind, which chases you down and commands smaller enemies around you. Throughout each level, you'll hit Action Points, which slow time and pop up a quick arcade-style puzzle, and you'll have a limited time to make your next move. Depending on what your move in the puzzle is, your Mayfly will jump, dodge, attack enemies, or smash through walls, helping you avoid the Hive Mind behind you.

Your puzzle moves can also collect power-ups for your Mayfly: 
* Wings let you jump higher
* Legs give you a temporary speed boost
* Fangs let you deal more damage in an attack
* Chitin Armor lets you take less damage when hit

While these power-ups only last for your current run, collecting them also earns you XP for each type, which you can spend in the main menu on permanent stat increases.
